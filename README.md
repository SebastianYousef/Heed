# notiApp

An Android notification filter. It reads everything that arrives, decides what actually
needs you, and keeps the rest in an inbox with a periodic summary. The judgement is a
small model that runs on the phone and learns from what you open and what you swipe away.

Nothing leaves the device.

## The constraint everything else follows from

Android gives a third-party app no way to stop a notification before it makes noise.

`NotificationListenerService.onNotificationPosted()` fires *after* delivery — the sound
has played, the phone has buzzed, the heads-up banner is on screen. Cancelling there
still works, but the user has already been interrupted; they just watch the notification
vanish. That is the flash you see in apps that try this.

The API that would solve it, `NotificationAssistantService`, runs *before* display and can
demote a notification's importance so it never alerts. It is `@SystemApi`: not on the
public SDK classpath, so an ordinary app cannot compile against it, never mind be selected
as the device's assistant. This is not device-dependent — it is closed to third-party apps
everywhere. (Verified by compiling against `android.jar` for API 35: `Unresolved reference
'NotificationAssistantService'`.)

So notiApp takes the other road: **make the sources silent and become the only thing on
the phone allowed to make noise.**

During onboarding you set your noisy apps to Silent in Android's own settings. They keep
arriving, they just stop interrupting. notiApp sees all of them through the listener, and
re-raises — with its own sound, its own channel — only the ones worth your attention.

The side effect is the good part. Because nothing has alerted you, latency stops mattering.
notiApp can hold a notification for a second or five, collect whatever else lands in that
window, and decide properly, instead of racing to cancel something that already went off.

## Pipeline

```
notification posted (silently, because the source app is muted)
        │
        ├─ ignorable?  ongoing / foreground service / media / no text  ──> untouched
        │
        ├─ rules ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
        │    hard overrides: calls, alarms, one-time codes    ──> always alert │
        │                    per-app Always / Never            ──> forced      │
        │                    app posted it at IMPORTANCE_MIN   ──> always file │
        │    otherwise a prior in 0..1 from category, people, importance, ...  │
        │                                                                     │
        ├─ classifier ── hashed features ──> logistic regression ──> 0..1      │
        │                                                                     │
        └─ blend, weighted by how much the model has actually seen ────────────┘
                 score = (1 − confidence)·prior + confidence·model
                 confidence = examples / (examples + 60)
        │
        ├─ hold window (default 2s) — collapse bursts, drop transients
        │
        └─ score ≥ threshold ?
              yes ──> notiApp raises its own alert, cancels the silent original
              no  ──> filed in the inbox, rolled into the next digest
```

A fresh install therefore behaves purely on rules, and the model fades in as you teach it.
Getting this wrong in the other direction — a coin-flip first week — is how an app like
this loses a user before it has learned anything.

## Why a linear model and not an LLM

Classification runs on the delivery path, on every notification, all day. The budget is
milliseconds and approximately zero battery. Hashed features plus logistic regression
trains online from a handful of examples, costs microseconds, and every weight maps to a
readable token or a named slot — which is what lets the detail screen show you *why*
something was filed. A model you cannot interrogate is one you stop trusting the first
time it is wrong.

Summarisation is the opposite shape: a few times a day, off the hot path, deferrable to
when the phone is charging. That is where an on-device LLM earns its keep, and
`Summarizer` is the seam for it — see the KDoc in `digest/Summarizer.kt` for wiring up
Gemma 3 1B through MediaPipe. The templated summariser it ships with is genuinely fine
until then, and free.

## Learning signal

| Event | Label | Weight |
|---|---|---|
| Tapped the notification | relevant | 1.0 |
| Swiped it away | noise | 0.4 |
| "I needed this" in the inbox | relevant | 3.0 |
| "Noise" in the inbox or the alert action | noise | 3.0 |

Swipes are deliberately weak — people clear notifications reflexively, and treating that
as a firm opinion teaches the model the wrong thing. Our own cancels are excluded
entirely; training on them would only teach the model to agree with itself.

## Layout

```
data/       Room entities, DAO, settings, repository (owns the model + caches)
capture/    listener service, notification mapping, hold buffer, decision engine
score/      feature extraction, rules, online classifier, blending pipeline
digest/     summariser interface + template implementation, WorkManager job
notify/     re-raising alerts, inline feedback action
ui/         Compose: onboarding, inbox, detail ("why"), settings, per-app rules
```

## Build

Needs JDK 17–21 (not 26 — AGP rejects it) and the Android SDK.

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk-21
./gradlew assembleDebug          # app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest      # 14 tests over features, rules, classifier, pipeline
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

Then grant notification access: Settings → Notifications → Device & app notifications.

## Status

Built and unit-tested; not yet run on a physical device. Worth checking first on hardware:

- how long `cancelNotification` actually takes for an app you have *not* silenced, to see
  how bad the fallback path feels in practice
- whether OEM battery management kills the listener service (Xiaomi and Samsung are the
  usual suspects; may need a whitelist prompt)
- whether the re-raised alert's `contentIntent` reliably opens the source app — it is held
  in memory only for the length of the hold window
